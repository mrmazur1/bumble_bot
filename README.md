# bumble_bot
Bot to automate my personal Bumble account. It uses a custom-made Pytorch-trained Neural Network model to calculate the attractiveness/compatibility that I would have with a user account. After calculations, it either likes or dislikes the account and can repeat this process automatically for hours. It can detect faces/people in photos and can react to various Bumble pop-ups/ads/messages to continue matching.
