# bumble-bot

Bot to automate my personal Bumble account. It uses a custom-made Pytorch-trained Neural Network model to calculate the attractiveness/compatibility that I would have with a user account. After calculations, it either likes or dislikes the account and can repeat this process automatically for hours. It can detect faces/people in photos and can react to various Bumble pop-ups/ads/messages to continue matching.

# VERY IMPORTANT READ BELOW

this is a work in progress and does not have a gui, Also the .pth file that holds all the values for the model weights is on a google drive (which you need for the program to run). This is because I dont feel like paying for more storage. link is below.
